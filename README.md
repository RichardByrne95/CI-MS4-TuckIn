### Django Secret Key Exposure

When starting off this project, I followed along with the course lectures to ensure that I had the project set up properly. In the course lecturers, however, the lecturer uploads the Django secret key to GitHub. I also did the same before realising what had happened. After contacting Student Care, they confirmed that removing 'settings.py' from GitHub in future commits and changing the Django secret key would be sufficient so as to not incur any penalties during grading.
